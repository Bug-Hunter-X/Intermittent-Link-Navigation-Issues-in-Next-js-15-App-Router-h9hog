# Intermittent Link Navigation Issues in Next.js 15 App Router

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router where links intermittently fail to navigate correctly.  The issue is inconsistent and doesn't occur every time, making it difficult to debug.

## Bug Description

Links using the `next/link` component sometimes fail to navigate to the intended pages.  The pages may not render, or the user might remain on the current page despite clicking the link. This behavior is unpredictable and seems to be related to how the app router handles routing events, potentially under high load or specific timing conditions.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Click the 'Home' and 'About' links repeatedly.  Note that sometimes the navigation will fail or the page will not render correctly. This is an intermittent issue.

## Potential Causes

* **Race conditions** in the App Router's routing logic.
* **Asynchronous operations** that are not properly handled within the `Link` component lifecycle.
* **Caching issues** causing stale data to be rendered.

## Solution

The provided solution explores the following strategies:

* **Improved data fetching:** Ensuring data is correctly fetched and displayed after navigation.   This approach addresses rendering issues after a successful navigation event.
* **Redundant navigation prevention:** This is an experimental solution and may be unnecessary depending on the root cause. Further investigation is needed to determine if this issue is indeed related to race conditions.
